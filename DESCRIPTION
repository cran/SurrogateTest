Description: Provides functions to test for a treatment effect in terms of the difference in survival between a treatment group and a control group using surrogate marker information obtained at some early time point in a time-to-event outcome setting. Nonparametric kernel estimation is used to estimate the test statistic and perturbation resampling is used for variance estimation. More details will be available in the future in: Parast L, Cai T, Tian L (2019). Using a Surrogate Marker for Early Testing of a Treatment Effect. Biometrics, In press.
